This task used Selenium to programmatically visit a target page, extract page metadata and paragraph content, and save the structured output for analysis. The provided script is a lightweight, headless Chrome template that navigates to a URL, waits for the document to load, collects textual elements (e.g., paragraphs) and writes a JSON result file. The summary highlights that results depend on accurate selectors and robust waiting strategies; in practice explicit waits (by element presence) should replace fixed sleep calls. The extraction revealed concise body text in the example site but real pages will require cleaning (removing navigation, ads, and duplicated boilerplate). The placeholder PNG included with this submission demonstrates how results could be visualized (screenshots or annotated snippets). For reproducibility, the script notes dependency versions and Chromedriver requirements. Next steps are to parameterize target URLs, implement error handling and retry logic, and add unit/integration tests for selector stability and rate-limiting resilience.
